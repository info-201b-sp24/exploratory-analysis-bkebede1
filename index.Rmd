### Abstract

No more than three sentences that summarize your project. Focus on the very most important aspects. For example: (1) "Our main question is .... This question is important because .... To address the question, we will ...." (2) "We are concerned with ..., because .... To address this concern, we plan to ...." (3) "Consider that .... This is important because .... Accordingly, we plan to ...."

Our main question is how do individual player statistics impact team performance? This question is important because it helps us understand the relationship individual performance
has with team success. Accordingly, we plan to create a detailed analysis on each player statistic, by comparing and visualizing these stats, we gain insights into player performance
and team dynamics.

### Keywords

3-5 keywords that summarize your project.
(e.g., "Keywords: human physiology; bicycle exercise; Gen Z; times-series data")
Individual statistics/performance, Player analysis, and Team success
### Introduction  

Briefly introduce your project.  Include 3-5 research questions. What motivates the questions? Why are they important? (at least 200 words)

In the world of professional basketball, knowing statistics is everything when it comes to team success. From the players themselves to the coaches and even other opposing teams 
information on player performance is crucial to player improvement and for teams making successful game plans and strategies for their success. This project explores the relationship
between  individual player metrics and team outcomes. By analyzing data from both the NBA and WNBA we aim to answer these important questions:

1. How does individual performance affect team success? 

This question investigates the statistics of player in different categories like points per game, assists, rebounds, etc.. and inspect their influence on overall team success.

2. What position makes the most impact on a team's success?

This question looks at each position, comparing them to each other to find the most impactful position.

3. Does better defense or offense result in a more successful season?

This question analyzes defensive and offensive stats to find out if either good defense or offense leads to a better season.

4. Are there statistical difference between the NBA and WNBA players?

This question explores the data for both leagues and searches for any differential trends that could be based on gender or other potential factors.

5. Is there a correlation between free throws and winning?

This question searches for a correlation between how well a teams free throw shooting contributes to a successful season.

In this project, we delve into the world of professional basketball, analyzing player statistics from both the NBA and WNBA. Our goal is to uncover insights that impact team performance,
inform coaching strategies, and guide decision-making. The first article dives into the multiple ways the NBA is currently leveraging data analytics to improve performance. It touches on
how teams are using player performance analysis data to optimize players' overall performance and create game strategies. They further explain how teams also used to scout other players 
for both implementing defensive game strategies, but also scouting for possible player acquisitions. The second article explores the most important stat in basketball and how coaches use
this to optimize their player's abilities and the team's success. The article states that efficiency is the most important statistic in basketball, they explain how efficiency statistics 
are calculated and what the meaning behind the numbers is. The third article carries out a statistical comparison between the NBA and WNBA. It delves into the statistical differences 
between the two leagues in the form of shot distributions, trajectories, and shooting percentages. It also includes multiple interactive charts and graphs to visualize the comparisons.
